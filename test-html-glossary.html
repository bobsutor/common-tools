  <strong>|0〉</strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt;">In quantum computing, “Ket 0” (written as |0〉) represents one of the two fundamental states of a qubit, analogous to the classical bit value of 0. It is a vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space, serving as one of the standard basis states for quantum computations. Mathematically, |0〉 is typically represented as a column vector with a 1 in the top position and a 0 in the bottom position. This state is orthogonal to its counterpart, |1〉, and together they form the computational basis for a single qubit. The |0〉 state is often used as the initial state for qubits in quantum algorithms and can be manipulated through quantum gates to create superpositions and entanglement.<em> Source: </em><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perplexity</a></p>

  <strong>|1〉</strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt;">In quantum computing, “Ket 1” is represented as |1〉 and denotes one of the two fundamental states of a qubit. It is part of the bra-ket notation used to describe quantum states, introduced by physicist Paul Dirac. Ket 1 corresponds to the logical 1 or “true” state in classical computing, but in the quantum realm, it represents a specific vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space. Unlike classical bits, which can only be in one state at a time, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both |0〉 and |1〉 states simultaneously. When measured, Ket 1 collapses the qubit's state, yielding a definite outcome of 1 with a probability determined by the qubit's quantum state prior to measurement.<em> Source: </em><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perplexity</a></p>
